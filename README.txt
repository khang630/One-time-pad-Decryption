To run type "g++ main.cpp", then "./a.out"
My program asks that you input your ciphertext file. I have provided the "ciphertext.txt" file that I have used.

The full decryption of the message is:

Hey Alice I am thinking that we need to have a party for her
I am thinking that it should be around her birthday not sure
Make sure to use my one time pad so she does not find it out
Hi Bob I think that is a great idea maybe around dinner time
I may have reused our one time pad but should be no big deal
Even if Eve noticed she will not be able to decrypt our plan
